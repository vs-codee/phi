            <p class="sectiontag text-big">More about golden Ratio</p>
            <p class="sectiontag text-small">Mathematicians since Euclid have studied the properties of the golden
                ratio,
                including its appearance in the dimensions of a regular pentagon and in a golden rectangle,
                which may be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same aspect ratio.
                The golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects
                as well as man-made systems such as financial markets,
                in some cases based on dubious fits to data.
                The golden ratio appears in some patterns in nature,
                including the spiral arrangement of leaves and other plant parts.
                Some twentieth-century artists and architects, including Le Corbusier and Salvador Dalí, have
                proportioned
                their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the
                ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be
                aesthetically
                pleasing.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-small">A 2004 geometrical analysis of earlier research into the Great Mosque of
                Kairouan (670) reveals an application of the golden ratio in much of the design.[40] They found ratios
                close to the golden ratio in the overall layout and in the dimensions of the prayer space, the court,
                and the minaret. However, the areas with ratios close to the golden ratio were not part of the original
                plan, and were likely added in a reconstruction.

                It has been speculated that the golden ratio was used by the designers of the Naqsh-e Jahan Square
                (1629) and the adjacent Lotfollah Mosque.

            <p class="sectiontag text-small">The number φ turns up frequently in geometry, particularly in figures with
                pentagonal symmetry. The length of a regular pentagon's diagonal is φ times its side. The vertices of a
                regular icosahedron are those of three mutually orthogonal golden rectangles.

                There is no known general algorithm to arrange a given number of nodes evenly on a sphere, for any of
                several definitions of even distribution (see, for example, Thomson problem). However, a useful
                approximation results from dividing the sphere into parallel bands of equal surface area and placing one
                node in each band at longitudes spaced by a golden section of the circle, i.e. 360°/φ ≅ 222.5°. This
                method was used to arrange the 1500 mirrors of the student-participatory satellite Starshine-3</p>
